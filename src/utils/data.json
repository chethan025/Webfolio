The game provides immediate feedback (“too high”, “too low”, or “correct”) and tracks the user’s score or attempt count dynamically. It features a responsive layout and a clean UI design so it works comfortably on both desktops and mobile devices. All logic is implemented without external libraries, keeping the code lightweight and easily understandable.",
